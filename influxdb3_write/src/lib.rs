//! This package contains definitions for writing data into InfluxDB3. The logical data model is the standard
//! InfluxDB model of Database > Table > Row. As the data arrives into the server it is written into the open
//! segment in the buffer. If the buffer has a WAL configured, the data is written into the WAL before being
//! buffered in memory.
//!
//! When the segment reaches a certain size, or a certain amount of time has passed, it will be closed and marked
//! to be persisted. A new open segment will be created and new writes will be written to that segment.
